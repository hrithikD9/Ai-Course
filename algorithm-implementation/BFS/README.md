# üå≥ Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

> **Breadth-First Search** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current depth level before moving to the next level, making it ideal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.

## üîß How the Algorithm Works

BFS explores a graph level by level, starting from a source node and visiting all neighbors before moving to the next level:

1. üèÅ Start at a specified source node
2. ‚úÖ Mark it as visited and enqueue it into a queue
3. üîÑ While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a vertex from the queue
   - Process the vertex (e.g., print it)
   - For each adjacent unvisited vertex:
     - Mark it as visited
     - Enqueue it

BFS uses a **queue** data structure which follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, ensuring vertices are processed in the order they're discovered, creating a level-by-level traversal pattern.

## üöÄ Applications of BFS

| Domain | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Pathfinding** | Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs |
| **Web Crawling** | Discovering and indexing web pages |
| **Social Networks** | Finding degrees of separation, friend recommendations |
| **Network Operations** | Broadcasting information across networks |
| **Puzzle Solving** | Finding optimal solutions to puzzles like 15-puzzle |
| **Component Analysis** | Identifying connected components in graphs |
| **Memory Management** | Garbage collection in programming languages |
| **Circuit Design** | Testing connectivity and reachability |

## ‚è± Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time** | `O(V + E)` where V is vertices and E is edges |
| **Space** | `O(V)` for queue and visited set storage |

**Key Performance Notes:**
- Each vertex is dequeued at most once: `O(V)`
- Each edge is considered at most once: `O(E)`
- In worst case, all vertices might be in the queue simultaneously

The efficiency of BFS makes it suitable for large graphs where finding the shortest path or closest nodes is important.

## üìà Sample Input & Output

### ‚å®Ô∏è Input Example

```python
# Graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
  'A': ['B', 'C'],
  'B': ['D', 'E', 'F'],
  'C': ['G'],
  'D': [],
  'E': [],
  'F': ['H'],
  'G': ['I'],
  'H': [],
  'I': []
}

# Starting node
start_node = 'A'
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Output Example

```
BFS Traversal: A B C D E F G H I
```

### üìä Explanation

In this example:
- We have a graph with 9 nodes (A through I) represented as an adjacency list
- Starting from node A, BFS first visits all immediate neighbors (B, C)
- Then it explores the next level (D, E, F, G)
- Finally, it visits the deepest level (H, I)
- The output shows the level-by-level traversal order

This demonstrates how BFS explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level. Notice how nodes are visited in order of their distance from the starting node, which is why BFS is optimal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
