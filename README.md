## üìã Course Purpose

This course was designed to provide a solid foundation in artificial intelligence through both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. The primary objectives were:

1. **Understanding Core AI Concepts**: Exploring fundamental principles that drive modern AI systems
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Developing coding skills by implementing classic AI algorithms
3. **Interactive Applications**: Creating AI-powered games that demonstrate decision-making algorithms
4. **Practical Experience**: Gaining hands-on experience with various AI paradigms and techniques
5. **Modern AI Tools**: Exploring contemporary AI content creation tools

## üéì What I Learned

### üìä AI Algorithms & Search Techniques

In the [algorithm-implementation](./algorithm-implementation) section, I implemented and analyzed various search and decision-making algorithms:

- **Uninformed Search Algorithms**: 
  - [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./algorithm-implementation/BFS) for complete, optimal path finding
  - [Depth-First Search (DFS)](./algorithm-implementation/DFS) for memory-efficient exploration
  - [Depth-Limited Search (DLS)](./algorithm-implementation/DLS) for controlled depth exploration
  - [Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)](./algorithm-implementation/Iterative-Deepening-Search) combining BFS optimality with DFS efficiency
  - [Bidirectional Search](./algorithm-implementation/Bi-Directional%20Search) for faster path finding by meeting in the middle

- **Informed Search Algorithms**: 
  - [Best-First Search](./algorithm-implementation/Best-First-Search) using heuristic evaluation
  - [A* Search](./algorithm-implementation/A-star) balancing path cost and heuristic estimation
  - [Beam Search](./algorithm-implementation/Beam-Search) for memory-constrained heuristic search
  - [Hill Climbing](./algorithm-implementation/Hill-Climb) for local optimization problems

- **Adversarial Search**: 
  - [Minimax Algorithm](./algorithm-implementation/Min-Max) for perfect play in zero-sum games
  - [Alpha-Beta Pruning](./algorithm-implementation/Alpha-Beta-Prunning) for efficient minimax computation

- **AND/OR Graphs**:
  - [AO* Algorithm](./algorithm-implementation/AO-star) for solving problems with multiple solution paths

### üéÆ AI in Games

The [ai-games](./ai-games) section showcases practical applications of AI algorithms in interactive games:

- **[Chess](./ai-games/Chess)**: Implementation of Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for strategic decision making
- **[Connect Four](./ai-games/Connect-Four)**: Simple heuristic-based AI for competitive gameplay
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](./ai-games/Tic-Tac-Toe)**: Perfect play using the Minimax algorithm

These games demonstrate how theoretical algorithms translate into engaging interactive experiences.

### üß† Theoretical Knowledge

  - Language understanding and generation techniques
  - Transformer models and attention mechanisms
  - Semantic analysis and contextual understanding

- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**:
  - Perception, planning and control systems
  - Sensor fusion and environmental mapping
  - Robot kinematics and motion planning

- **Intelligent Agents**:
  - Agent architectures and decision-making frameworks
  - Multi-agent systems and emergent behaviors
  - Reactive, deliberative, and hybrid agent approaches

### üîß AI Tools Exploration

In the [ai-tools-exploration](./ai-tools-exploration) section, I explored modern AI-powered content creation tools:

- **[AI Presentations](./ai-tools-exploration/ai-course-presentation)**: Creating educational slides using Gamma
- **[AI Video Creation](./ai-tools-exploration/ai-course-video)**: Developing instructional videos with InVideo
