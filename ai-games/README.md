# ðŸŽ® AI Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of classic games implemented with artificial intelligence opponents. Each game demonstrates different AI algorithms for game playing strategies, providing both entertainment and educational value for understanding how computers make decisions in game environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Games Included

| Game | Algorithm | Difficulty | Description |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| [Chess](./Chess/) | Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning | Medium-Hard | A complete implementation of chess with an AI opponent that can look multiple moves ahead |
| [Connect Four](./Connect-Four/) | Simple Heuristic-based AI | Easy-Medium | Vertical strategy game where players drop colored discs to connect four in a row |
| [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Tic-Tac-Toe/) | Minimax | Medium | Classic 3x3 grid game with an unbeatable AI that demonstrates perfect play |

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

These games demonstrate various concepts in AI and game theory:
- Game tree search techniques and their practical limitations
- Minimax algorithm implementation with varying levels of complexity
- Alpha-beta pruning for optimization of tree-based search
- Heuristic evaluation functions for estimating game positions
- Simple vs complex state spaces and their impact on AI approach
- Trade-offs between perfect play and computational efficiency
- How different games require different AI strategies

Each game includes its own detailed README file explaining the specific AI implementation details, game rules, and strategic considerations. These implementations serve as practical examples of AI concepts in action, making abstract algorithms tangible and interactive.
