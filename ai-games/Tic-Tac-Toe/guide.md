# Tic Tac Toe with AI: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide for a Tic Tac Toe game with artificial intelligence! This guide explains everything from the basic game structure to how the computer "thinks" when deciding its moves.

## What is This Project?

This is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game where you play against the computer. The computer uses an algorithm called "minimax" to make smart decisions, making it very challenging to beat.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
2. You play as X and always go first
3. Click on any empty square to place your X
4. The computer will automatically make its move (O)
5. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
6. If all squares are filled and no one has three in a row, the game ends in a draw
7. Click "New Game" to start over at any time

## Project Structure

Our game is split into three files:

### 1. HTML (index.html)
This file creates the structure of our game page, including:
- The title
- Status messages
- The game board
- New Game button

### 2. CSS (styles.css)
This file handles all the visual styling:
- Colors and fonts
- The layout of the game board
- Button appearances
- Visual feedback when hovering over cells

### 3. JavaScript (script.js)
This is where all the game logic lives:
- Game state tracking
- Handling player moves
- Computer AI (minimax algorithm)
- Checking for wins or draws

## How the Code Works

Let's break down the most important parts of the code:

### Game Board Representation

The game board is represented as an array with 9 elements, where each element can be:
- An empty string ('') for an empty cell
- 'X' for the human player's mark
- 'O' for the computer's mark

```
Board positions:
 0 | 1 | 2
-----------
 3 | 4 | 5
-----------
 6 | 7 | 8
```

### Game State Variables

```javascript
let board = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']; // The game board
let currentPlayer = 'X';                          // Current player ('X' or 'O')
let gameActive = true;                            // Whether the game is still in progress
```

### Winning Combinations

```javascript
const winningCombinations = [
    [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], // rows
    [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], // columns
    [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]             // diagonals
];
```

Each sub-array represents one way to win:
- Rows: top, middle, bottom
- Columns: left, middle, right
- Diagonals: top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left

### Human Player Move

When you click on a cell, the `handleCellClick` function:
1. Checks if the cell is empty and the game is still active
2. Places your 'X' in that cell
3. Checks if you've won or if it's a draw
4. If the game continues, it's the computer's turn

```javascript
function handleCellClick(event) {
    const clickedCellIndex = parseInt(event.target.getAttribute('data-index'));
    
    // Check if cell is already filled or game is not active
    if (board[clickedCellIndex] !== '' || !gameActive || currentPlayer !== 'X') {
        return;
    }
    
    // Update the game state for human player (X)
    board[clickedCellIndex] = 'X';
    event.target.textContent = 'X';
    
    // Check if the game is over after human move
    // ...
    
    // Switch to computer's turn
    currentPlayer = 'O';
    statusDisplay.textContent = 'Computer is thinking...';
    
    // Add a small delay to make the computer's move feel more natural
    setTimeout(makeComputerMove, 600);
}
```

### Computer Player Move

After you make your move, the computer uses the minimax algorithm to determine its best move:

```javascript
function makeComputerMove() {
    if (!gameActive) return;
    
    // Find the best move for the computer
    const bestMove = findBestMove();
    
    // Update the board with the computer's move
    board[bestMove] = 'O';
    document.querySelector(`.cell[data-index="${bestMove}"]`).textContent = 'O';
    
    // Check if the game is over after computer move
    // ...
    
    // Switch back to human player
    currentPlayer = 'X';
    statusDisplay.textContent = 'Your turn';
}
```

## The Minimax Algorithm: How the Computer "Thinks"

The minimax algorithm is what makes the computer player smart. It's a decision-making algorithm that helps the computer find the best move by looking ahead at all possible future moves.

### How Minimax Works (Simple Explanation)

1. The computer imagines trying each available empty space
2. For each possible move, it thinks about how the game might end
3. It gives scores to different outcomes:
   - If computer wins: +10 points // he chay je tare maximum korto
   - If game is a draw: 0 points
   - If human wins: -10 points // human tare lower kori dey
4. The computer chooses the move with the highest score

### Step-by-Step Example

Imagine this board where it's the computer's turn (O):
```
 X |   | X
-----------
   | O |  
-----------
   |   |  
```

The computer considers placing an 'O' at position 6 to block X from winning:
```
 X |   | X
-----------
   | O |  
-----------
 O |   |  
```

It also considers placing an 'O' at position 1:
```
 X | O | X
-----------
   | O |  
-----------
   |   |  
```

Looking ahead, the computer realizes that position 1 gives it a chance to win by creating a diagonal line, while position 6 only prevents a loss. So it chooses position 1.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
// Find the best move for the computer
function findBestMove() {
    let bestScore = -Infinity;
    let bestMove;
    
    // Try each empty cell
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
        if (board[i] === '') {
            // Make a temporary move
            board[i] = 'O';
            
            // Calculate the score for this move
            const score = minimax(board, 0, false);
            
            // Undo the move
            board[i] = '';
            
            // Update best move if this move has a higher score
            if (score > bestScore) {
                bestScore = score;
                bestMove = i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return bestMove;
}

// Minimax algorithm for determining the best move
function minimax(board, depth, isMaximizing) {
    // Check for terminal states (win, lose, draw)
    if (checkWin('O')) {
        return 10 - depth; // Computer wins (prefer quicker wins)
    }
    
    if (checkWin('X')) {
        return depth - 10; // Human wins (prefer later losses)
    }
    
    if (checkDraw()) {
        return 0; // Draw
    }
    
    if (isMaximizing) {
        // Computer's turn (maximize score)
        let bestScore = -Infinity;
        for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            if (board[i] === '') {
                board[i] = 'O';
                const score = minimax(board, depth + 1, false);
                board[i] = '';
                bestScore = Math.max(score, bestScore);
            }
        }
        return bestScore;
    } else {
        // Human's turn (minimize score)
        let bestScore = Infinity;
        for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            if (board[i] === '') {
                board[i] = 'X';
                const score = minimax(board, depth + 1, true);
                board[i] = '';
                bestScore = Math.min(score, bestScore);
            }
        }
        return bestScore;
    }
}
```

### Understanding the Minimax Function

## Common Questions

### Why can't I beat the computer?

The minimax algorithm explores all possible moves and outcomes, so it always makes the optimal move. In Tic Tac Toe, when both players play perfectly, the game always ends in a draw. This means if the computer uses minimax, the best you can hope for is a draw!

### Does the computer know my next move?

The computer doesn't know for sure what move you'll make, but it assumes you'll make the best possible move for yourself. It plans its strategy assuming you're playing perfectly.

### Is the computer cheating?

No! The computer just uses logic to look ahead at all possible moves and their outcomes. It's like a chess player thinking several moves ahead, but the computer can do it much faster and without making mistakes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You now understand how a Tic Tac Toe game with AI works. The minimax algorithm is actually a fundamental concept in game theory and artificial intelligence. While our implementation is specific to Tic Tac Toe, similar algorithms are used in more complex games like chess and Go.

Here's what you've learned:

1. **HTML & CSS**: How to structure and style a web game
2. **JavaScript**: How to manage game state and player interactions
3. **Game Logic**: How to check for wins and draws
4. **Artificial Intelligence**: How the minimax algorithm helps computers make decisions

Try playing a few games against the computer. Can you manage to get a draw? Remember, with perfect play on both sides, the game should always end in a draw. If you're losing, try to think ahead like the computer does!

Happy gaming!

## How to Play

Now that you understand how the code works, let's see how to actually play the game:

1. **Open the Game**: 
   - Open the `index.html` file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

2. **Starting the Game**:
   - The game starts automatically with Player X's turn
   - You'll see a message that says "Player X's turn"

3. **Making Moves**:
   - Player X clicks on any empty cell to place an X
   - Then Player O takes a turn and clicks on an empty cell to place an O
   - Players continue taking turns

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
   - The game will display a message like "Player X wins!" when someone wins

5. **Draw Game**:
   - If all nine cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw
   - The game will display "Game ended in a draw!" in this case

6. **Starting a New Game**:
   - Click the "Reset Game" button at any time to clear the board and start over
   - You can do this whether the game is finished or still in progress

Try playing a few games with a friend to see how it works!

## Future Enhancements: Adding a Computer Player

In the future, you can enhance this game to play against a computer using something called the "minimax algorithm." Don't worry if that sounds complicated! The code is already structured to make this easier to add later.

The minimax algorithm helps the computer figure out the best possible move by:
1. Looking ahead at all possible future moves
2. Assigning scores to different outcomes (win, lose, draw)
3. Choosing the move that leads to the best possible outcome

To add AI to this game in the future, you would:

1. **Create an AI Function**:
   - Add a new function that calculates the best move for the computer
   - The function would use the current `board` array to decide where to place an O

2. **Modify the Turn Logic**:
   - Change the code so that when it's Player O's turn, the computer makes the move
   - For Player X, keep the current click functionality for human input

3. **Add a Game Mode Selector**:
    - Human vs. Computer

This future enhancement will make your game much more interesting as you can play against the computer when you don't have a friend around!
